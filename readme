Description: 

We have 13 classes: 

3 interfaces:  
Polynom_Able 
Cont_function 
Function
 
3 regular classes :
Polynom 
Monom 
Test class 

3 junits:
TestPolynom
TestMonom
AllTest

1 Compartor class 
2 Exception class 
1 Graph class

Functions: 
Get the area above/under the X line with Riemann's Integral, Subtract, Multiply, Derivative, Copy, Equals, isZero, F(x) is the y value,  Root which finds a root of the function.
There is function to draw the polynom
